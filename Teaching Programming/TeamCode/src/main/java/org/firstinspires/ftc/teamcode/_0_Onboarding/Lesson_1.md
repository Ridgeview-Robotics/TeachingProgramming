Welcome to Lesson 1.  

This Lesson will not interact with android studio.  Instead we will be using the Driver Hubs.  

Hopefully by this point, you and/or a partner already have a test robot built or in the works.  
We will start by working on the rev hubs and their integration with your robot.

Go ahead and grab yourself a REV Driver hub, the small black tablet looking things.  Once you have 
that and your robot, go ahead and power your robot on.  Once the green light is activated, make sure
that your Driver Hub is connected to your Control Hub on the robot by Wi-Fi.  (To check the Wi-Fi 
SSID and Password of your robot, check out the REV Hardware Client on a computer.)  Once they are 
connected, do into the three dots on the top right of the screen inside of the FTC Driver Station
app on the Driver Hub.  Select the Configure menu, and create a new Configuration.  Now is the time
to make a map or something of the sort of your robot wire connections.  Motors will be installed in 
the white pin board on the left side of each Hub.  Servos will be installed in one of the six slots
on the bottom of the Hub.  Select each of these and mark wisely what the names of motors/servos are 
in the configuration menu.  These will be important to have marked down later on.  For example if 
you have a 4 motor drive robot, it could be wise to mark them accordingly like, 0 - leftRear, 1 - 
leftFront ... etc.  This is your hardware map.  


Java Syntax:

These are a few good points to keep in mind, however just as a reminder, every statement in java must
close with a semi-colon.  All classes must have curled brackets at the beginning and end of a class. 
All code in this repository will have correct syntax, and may be used as a reference.
